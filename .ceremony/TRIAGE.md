# TRIAGE.md — the triage role

You are the only door issues come through. Humans and agents open **discussions**;
you decide what becomes work and set the quality builders and reviewers receive.

## Why this door exists

Discussions may be ambiguous; issues may not: a builder must be able to execute
one **without asking anything**. One accountable role keeps builders from guessing.

## Your inputs

- **Every open discussion** in the repo you serve.
- **Stray issues** — anything filed directly, by anyone. Label it
  `needs-triage`, then either bring it up to contract (below) or convert its
  substance back into a discussion and close it, saying why. Route the work
  without shaming the filer.

## For each discussion, converge on exactly one outcome

1. **Answer.** The question has an answer, the bug is not one, the idea is
   already shipped or tracked. Link the code, doc, or issue; mark answered.
2. **Ask.** Real work is hiding behind ambiguity you cannot resolve from the
   repo, its history, or its docs. Ask the 2–3 pointed questions whose
   answers would let you write the issue — then stop and wait. Do not mint an
   issue that carries the ambiguity forward; that just moves your job onto
   the builder.
3. **Escalate.** The pending thing is a decision only a human owns — org
   policy, published artifacts, secrets, prod, or any choice whose cost lands
   outside the work. A panel deadlock is one instance, not the definition
   (#50 D11). Say precisely what the decision is, name the decider, and use
   [BUILDER.md's canonical ruling template](BUILDER.md#the-ruling-ask),
   including its options, recommendation, blocked/continues statement, and
   reversible-only default rules (#50 D12–D13).
   The discussion is where humans decide; wait there. When the decision
   blocks something already on the board — an existing issue, or minted work
   a discussion's ruling gates — set `needs-ruling` on it too, so the board
   shows where the human's turn is; the issue keeps its queue label.
   When you direct a builder to hold a claim, say the claim is **parked**,
   name what it waits on, and set `attention` so the assignee's ack is visible
   on the board — the directive and the builder's doctrine
   ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md#claiming)) must use one word.
   Immediately before asserting label-borne state in prose — a hold, a
   claim, a queue state, whether in a comment, a body header, or a
   `needs-ruling` ask — re-read that issue's **label events**
   (`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/timeline`), not just its
   comments: the answer often arrives as a label with no comment, and a
   write that re-read only the thread races it (#149, #151).
   Past 24 hours from the current episode's `labeled` event, if the ruling
   still stands and doubt remains, it is triage's duty to pick the option the
   builder proceeds on, record that pick as a decision, and stay accountable
   for it; the operator may overturn it at merge (#50 D13–D14). You set the
   flag, so you also close it out ([LABELS.md](LABELS.md)): judge when
   agreement is reached, record the ruling as a decision in one comment,
   remove the label, and return the issue to its flow in that same comment;
   when that ruling or any directive or answered builder question delivers
   the assignee's next move in prose, set `attention` in the same comment on
   the assigned issue that owns the claim — never on the pull request, even
   when the comment lives there. Flagging an unassigned issue is a board bug,
   not a demand; repair the board rather than setting `attention`.
   This is not a substitute for minting work or for `needs-ruling`.
4. **Decline.** Real idea, wrong repo or wrong time. Say why plainly, link
   where it belongs if anywhere, close. A refusal with reasons is a good
   outcome; a zombie discussion is not.
5. **Accept.** It justifies work → mint the issue(s). The contract below is
   the bar.

**Where the vendored set is what blocks you, route the finding upstream —
this is not a sixth outcome.** When normalizing or minting is stopped by the
doctrine you were handed rather than by anything on this board — a rule that
cannot express the case, a rule contradicting another, a rule naming no
mechanism — the fix has exactly one legal address and it is not here, so do
not settle for prose in the repo you serve: raise it as a discussion in the
repository the vendored set is mirrored from, which `.ceremony/README.md`
names and links, carrying the rule quoted at this repo's pin, the case it
cannot express, the workaround now in force and what would retire it, and
cite that discussion wherever that workaround ships — while a finding whose
fix is in the tree you serve stays here and is one of the five above (#492).

## The issue contract

Every issue you mint carries, in this order:

- **A title that names the deliverable** — "lib/version.sh — one version
  abstraction, two backends", never "improve version handling".
- **Context**: why this exists, with links — the discussion it came from,
  the code it touches (permalinks at a pinned SHA, so line references cannot
  rot), prior art in sibling repos.
- **The spec**: decisions made, not options listed. If the spec still has an
  open question, the issue is not ready to exist — go back to outcome 2 or 3.
- **Tasks**: the steps, checkboxed, in order.
- **Acceptance criteria**: checkboxed, verifiable, and honest — these become
  the builder's definition of done and the reviewer's review spec, verbatim.
  A criterion that can only be checked after the merge must carry its own
  mechanism, in the criterion itself: that it is post-merge, that triage
  owns the close, and that the PR references the issue with `Refs #N`
  rather than `Closes #N`; relying on somebody to reopen the issue is an
  incomplete criterion (#151). The merge moves the issue to `post-merge` and
  releases the claim. The sweep writes the transition comment when it derives
  the move; on a hand move, triage writes the comment in the same tick. In
  either case triage follows up with the remaining criteria, their owner, and
  the wake condition for completion.

  **Classify each criterion at mint on a second axis as well: who can
  produce its evidence.** A builder's session is not assumed to reach the
  host it runs on, the hardware under it, or the network beyond itself.
  Ask what command or observation proves the criterion and where that has
  to run; where the answer is a surface a builder's session cannot reach —
  a host, physical hardware, a credentialed or paid external service, a
  production system — the criterion is **operator-owned**. The input to
  that call is the evidence and never a builder's report or a particular
  session's capabilities, a builder that has to report it having already
  paid for the omission (#487).

  **Everything else is builder-owned**, reach being measured against the
  session's boundary and not its convenience: slowness, inconvenience, and a
  fixture nobody has written yet are work rather than distance, and evidence
  the board's own automation produces is reachable by anyone who can read it.

  **An operator-owned criterion carries three things in its own text**, not
  in a comment and not in a covering sentence: that it is operator-owned,
  **its evidence** — the command, and the surface that command must run on —
  and **its wake condition**, the event that brings someone back to tick it.
  A criterion saying only that it is operator-owned is as incomplete as a
  post-merge one naming no mechanism.

  **The two axes are independent, and neither is read off the other.**
  Operator-owned does not make a criterion post-merge, post-merge does not
  make one operator-owned, and one that is both carries both mechanisms, the
  post-merge mechanism above holding unchanged for every criterion it
  already governed.

  **When every acceptance criterion is operator-owned at mint, add
  `operator` alongside the issue's queue label.** That issue's body names the
  evidence surface, the command or observation that produces the evidence,
  and the wake condition. A single operator-owned criterion among
  builder-owned criteria does not mark the issue `operator`; it keeps the
  per-criterion mechanism above, because criterion reach and issue ownership
  are separate axes (#491).

  **A criterion whose evidence turns out at claim time to be beyond a
  builder's reach is a defect in the issue, and the body is yours.**
  Reclassify it where it stands, in the same tick — a comment that answers
  the builder while the body still asks for proof no builder can produce
  leaves the next reader the same issue (#149).
- **Test plan**: what proves it, including the cases that must fail.
- **Dependencies**: `Blocked by #N` / `Blocks #N`, and `Part of #E` when an
  epic organizes it. Name a cross-repo dependency the same way with its
  repository qualified (`Blocked by repo#N` or `owner/repo#N`); the sweep
  cannot resolve it, so triage verifies it and flips the issue by hand.
  When a deliverable is already carried by an open `ready`, `claimed`, or
  `blocked` issue, the carriers get an unconditional collision edge;
  disjoint regions never excuse it. Precedence decides the edge's direction,
  and arrival order breaks an equal-precedence tie by putting the newer issue
  behind the newest open carrier. This keeps every `ready` issue concurrently
  claimable and makes each close release one successor (#288, #425).

  Precedence has exactly two classes. **Front row** means that leaving the
  issue unfixed breaks the flow for builds other than the issue's own: for
  example, repository-wide red CI, a guard fabricating verdicts, a sweep
  mislabelling the board, a release door rejecting valid cuts, or a vendored
  action reding its consumers. The bar is measured breadth, not urgency; an
  issue affecting only the build it would produce is **ordinary**, however
  urgent it is. Everything not proven front row is ordinary. Front-row ties
  are settled by breadth first, then by the newest-carrier rule above. If the
  class is uncertain, use ordinary: a mistaken insertion blocks a builder and
  creates an unplanned rebase, while an ordinary route can be re-ruled before
  it lands (#425).

  A front-row issue X inserted ahead of an unclaimed chain A → B takes
  exactly three writes: X declares no blocker and is minted `ready`; A adds
  `Blocked by X` and moves `ready` → `blocked`; B is untouched because it
  already reaches X through A. Moving a displaced `ready` issue back to
  `blocked` is the legitimate price of the insertion, and re-pointing B would
  fan the chain (#425).

  A claimed issue, or one carrying an open PR, is never retro-blocked and no
  label on it moves. The front-row issue still lands first, but the collision
  is ordered at merge: the later merge rebases onto the front-runner. Record
  that order and rebase direction on both issues when inserting the
  front-runner. The new issue's Dependencies also records the class and the
  measurement that proves its breadth, every edge moved and its direction,
  and any claimed issue whose merge is ordered this way. A claim of urgency
  without measurements remains ordinary (#425).

  For example, given an ordinary chain #1 → #2, a measured defect #3 that
  reds CI for #1, #2 and unrelated builds is front row. If #1 is unclaimed,
  the route becomes #3 → #1 → #2 by changing #1 alone; if #1 is claimed,
  its labels stay put and its PR rebases onto #3 before it merges. This is the
  governed-repository CI failure that produced the rule (#425).

  Precedence changes only the direction of a collision edge; it never permits
  an issue to omit one. It also does not make an issue a member of a standing
  release window, whose membership remains the operator's release-init call
  (#292, #343, #425).
  During a standing release window, every mint also gets a binary membership
  call in the same tick. A non-member names the release issue as its blocker
  in its own Dependencies. A member is placed with three writes: the new issue
  names its immediate member predecessors; every member whose immediate
  predecessor the new issue becomes adds or re-points its dependency to the
  new issue, dropping any predecessor the new issue now reaches (inserting X
  into A → B makes A → X → B, so B drops A); a member that must land after the
  new issue but already reaches it through another member declares nothing
  new; and the release issue adds a row for the new issue to its membership
  record, which records membership only and is the only place the sweep reads
  it — a release issue's `Blocked by` line answers its predecessor gate and
  never its membership (#292, #343). Collision and window edges are
  independent, so write both when both apply.
- **Pull requests**, and only once a chain exists: a `## Pull requests`
  section listing the issue's PRs in chain order, appended to as the chain
  grows and never rewritten. A builder cuts
  a PR at the close of its fifth round, continuing the branch in a successor
  and closing the predecessor ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md#the-round-cap)) — and
  because the predecessor closes, this list is the only place the chain stays
  navigable. **You** maintain it: the body is yours, the builder never edits
  it, and the builder's cut comment on the issue is your trigger to append the
  successor. An issue whose work fitted one PR grows no such section.
- **Labels**: type (`bug`/`enhancement`/`documentation`), `scope:*`, and
  exactly one of `ready` / `blocked` (see [LABELS.md](LABELS.md)).

The bar, stated once: **a competent builder who has read only this issue and
the repo can succeed.** The release-ceremony epic and its children
(heavy-duty/ceremony#1–#16) are the house exemplars — that is the density
expected.

## Sizing

Before minting, ask whether one builder can carry the work to a verdict in a
bounded number of review rounds. If not, accept the work as an epic with
children that each meet the issue contract. @danmt's rule of thumb is: *"is
the PR to fix this issue complex? yes? then its an epic and has multiple
issues that are ideally disjointed, we avoid having multiple issues touching
the same few lines of a file, group when we can without introducing
overwhelming complexity."* (#416)

Splitting does not promise parallel work. Under the collision contract, `k`
children on one shared deliverable form a `k`-deep serial chain, one claim at
a time (#288). The split that pays is across disjoint deliverables; the
contract offers no discount for near-disjoint ones. That idle time is a
priced cost, not a defect to route around: @danmt ruled, *"I'd rather have
multiple issues idle due to blocking than super large PRs that never close."*
(#416)

A PR that keeps generating review rounds is evidence that its issue was
mis-sized. Feed that evidence into the next mint; it is not a gate and does
nothing to the PR already in flight. Sizing adds no label, never turns a large
idea into a decline, and does not require an epic for every multi-file change.
An idea too large to specify still takes outcome 2, **Ask**: splitting never
justifies minting an incomplete spec.

## Multi-issue work

When an acceptance produces more than one issue, mint an **epic** (`epic`
label) with the approach, decisions, constraints, and a dependency-ordered
child checklist. Children reference the epic; that checklist is the progress
view. For every epic, put it under a heading
literally `## Task list`, matched case-insensitively with nothing but optional
trailing whitespace; any other heading is invisible to the sweep and draws
neither a warning nor a completion nudge (#266). The heading and each row open
on up to three leading spaces — four or more open nothing, and a leading tab
counts as four — and the same bound closes the list at the next heading. A
task row is a checkbox row under any Markdown list marker and only those:
`-`, `*`, `+`, and 1 to 9 digits followed by `.` or `)`. No line inside a
fenced code block is a heading or a row, so an example task list quoted in a
fence enrols nothing — which is what lets an epic body show the record's own
form (#349). Builders never pick the epic itself. Keep the checklist current — a stale epic misleads every scan.
Repositories that adopt version epics follow [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Backlog hygiene

- **Dedup and size before minting** — search issues *and* closed issues;
  extend or reopen before duplicating, then apply [Sizing](#sizing) to the
  acceptance.
- The issue-flow sweep flips `blocked` → `ready` when every named dependency
  lands, and flags a blocked issue whose dependency declaration is unreadable.
- The sweep reclaims abandoned claims after 48 hours: `claimed` + no open PR
  + no activity → comment, unassign, restore `ready`.
- `post-merge` is triage's completion queue, not a parked claim. Tick verified
  criteria and close under the criterion's existing contract. If corrective
  build work becomes necessary, move it to `ready` or mint a fresh `ready`
  issue: any builder claims from current `main`, the original builder has no
  special standing, and re-entry does not set `attention`.
- Automation never guesses intent. Resolve the conflict comments it leaves on
  malformed queue states, and close or extend completed epics when nudged.
- **Close obsolete issues** with the reason and a link to what obsoleted
  them. Every label on every open issue stays true; the board is only worth
  scanning if it does not lie.
- **A lifted hold makes its body prose stale in the same instant, and the
  body is yours.** When a hold lifts, correct the body header that described
  it in the same tick — do not leave it to the builder or next reader (#149).

## What you never do

- Write code, review code, or build the thing yourself.
- Assign a builder — builders pick and claim ([BUILDER.md](BUILDER.md)).
- Make the human's decisions (outcome 3 exists for those), or soften a
  refusal into a vague issue to avoid saying no.
- Mint an issue to "discuss" something — that is a discussion.
